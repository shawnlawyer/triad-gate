# TRIAD-GATE v1

Triad-Gate Version 1 is an early prototype of the triad-based reasoning framework. It introduced:
- A single-agent simulation of three roles: Coordinator, Validator, and Challenger.
- A gatekeeper that requires an exact start signal before any planning or reasoning can occur.
- A simple sequential turn order (Coordinator → Validator → Challenger).
- A focus on storing only structured framework artifacts rather than full transcripts.

Version 1 did not include multi-session continuity or portfolio management; it served as a foundational experiment for later versions.
