# TRIAD-GATE v2

Triad-Gate Version 2 expanded upon the foundational v1 design. Key additions included:

- Improved role isolation and more detailed definitions for the Coordinator, Validator, and Challenger.
- Introduction of a basic multi-session capability, allowing the system to persist structured artifacts (plans, validations, challenges) across sessions.
- Early support for dependency tracking and checkpoints to structure the execution of plans.
- Expanded gatekeeper contract that enforced a start signal and defined goal intake schema with objective, constraints, and success criteria.
- Enhanced safety and scope guidance, emphasizing non-prescriptive outputs and research-grade planning.

Version 2 laid the groundwork for the more robust multi-session and portfolio features introduced in later versions.
